    on the highway, we have taken him off the road and he has crashed on the road.
    In compliance with your orders, we left no trace of us and everything appears
    to have been a mere traffic accident. \n\nThe individual no longer represents
    an obstacle. \n\nI confirm the time and place previously indicated for receipt
    of payment for the mission.\n\n\n\nSincerely, Andrew"
